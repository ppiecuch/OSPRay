Version History
---------------

### Changes in v1.0.0:

-   New OSPRay 'SDK'
    -   OSPRay internal headers are now installed, enabling applications
        to extend OSPRay from a binary install
    -   CMake macros for OSPRay and ISPC configuration now a part of
        binary releases
        -   CMake clients use them by calling
            `include(${OSPRAY_USE_FILE})` in their CMake code after
            calling `find_package(ospray)`
    -   New OSPRay C++ wrapper classes
        -   These act as a thin layer on top of OSPRay object handles,
            where multiple wrappers will share the same underlying
            handle when assigned, copied, or moved
        -   New OSPRay objects are only created when a class instance is
            explicity constructed
        -   C++ users are encouraged to use these over the `ospray.h`
            API
-   Complete rework of sample applications
    -   New shared code for parsing the `commandline`
    -   Save/load of transfer functions now handled through a separate
        library which does not depend on Qt
    -   Added `ospCvtParaViewTfcn` utility, which enables
        `ospVolumeViewer` to load color maps from ParaView
    -   GLUT based sample viewer updates
        -   Rename of `ospModelViewer` to `ospGlutViewer`
        -   GLUT viewer now supports volume rendering
        -   Command mode with preliminary scripting capabilities,
            enabled by pressing '`:`' key (not available when using
            Intel C++ compiler (icc))
    -   Enhanced support of sample applications on Windows
-   New minimum ISPC version is 1.9.0
-   Support of Intel® AVX-512 for second generation Intel® Xeon Phi™
    processor (codename Knights Landing) is now a part of the
    `OSPRAY_BUILD_ISA` CMake build configuration
    -   Compiling AVX-512 requires icc to be enabled as a build option
-   Enhanced error messages when `ospLoadModule()` fails
-   Added `OSP_FB_RGBA32F` support in the `DistributedFrameBuffer`
-   Updated Glass shader in the PathTracer
-   Many miscellaneous cleanups, bugfixes, and improvements

### Changes in v0.10.1:

-   Fixed support of first generation Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor
    (codename Knights Corner)
-   Restored missing implementation of `ospRemoveVolume()`

### Changes in v0.10.0:

-   Added new tasking options: `Cilk`, `Internal`, and `Debug`
    -   Provides more ways for OSPRay to interact with calling
        application tasking systems
        - `Cilk`: Use Intel® Cilk™ Plus language extensions (icc only)
        - `Internal`: Use hand written OSPRay tasking system
        - `Debug`: All tasks are run in serial (useful for debugging)
    -   In most cases, Intel Threading Building Blocks (Intel `TBB`)
        remains the fastest option
-   Added support for adaptive accumulation and stopping
    -   `ospRenderFrame` now returns an estimation of the variance in
        the rendered image if the framebuffer was created with the
        `OSP_FB_VARIANCE` channel
    -   If the renderer parameter `varianceThreshold` is set,
        progressive refinement concentrates on regions of the image with
        a variance higher than this threshold
-   Added support for volumes with voxelType `ushort` (16-bit unsigned
    integers)
-   `OSPTexture2D` now supports sRGB formats -- actually most images are
    stored in sRGB. As a consequence the API call `ospNewTexture2D()`
    needed to change to accept the new `OSPTextureFormat` parameter.
-   Similarly, OSPRay's framebuffer types now also distinguishes between
    linear and sRGB 8-bit formats. The new types are `OSP_FB_NONE`,
    `OSP_FB_RGBA8`, `OSP_FB_SRGBA`, and `OSP_FB_RGBA32F`
-   Changed "scivis" renderer parameter defaults
    -   All shading (AO + shadows) must be explicitly enabled
-   OSPRay can now use a newer, pre-installed Embree enabled by the new
    `OSPRAY_USE_EXTERNAL_EMBREE` CMake option
-   New `ospcommon` library used to separately provide math types and OS
    abstractions for both OSPRay and sample apps
    -   Removes extra dependencies on internal Embree math types and
        utility functions
    -   `ospray.h` header is now C99 compatible
-   Removed loaders module, functionality remains inside of
    `ospVolumeViewer`
-   Many miscellaneous cleanups, bugfixes, and improvements:
    -   Fixed data distributed volume rendering bugs when using less
        blocks than workers
    -   Fixes to CMake `find_package()` config
    -   Fix bug in `GhostBlockBrickVolume` when using `double`s
    -   Various robustness changes made in CMake to make it easier to
        compile OSPRay

### Changes in v0.9.1:

-   Volume rendering now integrated into the "scivis" renderer
    -   Volumes are rendered in the same way the "dvr" volume renderer
        renders them
    -   Ambient occlusion works with implicit isosurfaces, with a known
        visual quality/performance trade-off
-   Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor (codename Knights Corner) COI device and
    build infrastructure restored (volume rendering is known to still be
    broken)
-   New support for CPack built OSPRay binary redistributable packages
-   Added support for HDRI lighting in path tracer
-   Added `ospRemoveVolume()` API call
-   Added ability to render a subsection of the full view into the
    entire framebuffer in the perspective camera
-   Many miscellaneous cleanups, bugfixes, and improvements:
    -   The depthbuffer is now correctly populated by in the "scivis"
        renderer
    -   Updated default renderer to be "ao1" in ospModelViewer
    -   Trianglemesh postIntersect shading is now 64-bit safe
    -   Texture2D has been reworked, with many improvements and bug fixes
    -   Fixed bug where MPI device would freeze while rendering frames
        with Intel TBB
    -   Updates to CMake with better error messages when Intel TBB is
        missing
